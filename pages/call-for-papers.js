            The proposed 6th International Conference on Information Systems and
            Management Science (ISMS 2023) provides a platform for researchers
            and professionals to share their research and reports of new
            technologies and applications in Information Systems and Management
            Science. The ISMS 2023 aims to bridge the gap between these
            non-coherent disciplines of knowledge and fosters unified
            development in next generation computational models for management
            information systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            All accepted and presented papers will be reviewed for possible
            publication in SPRINGER Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems
            (LNNS).
          </p>
          <p>
            Please consider submitting your works to this conference. We are
            interested in the entire range of concepts from theory to practice,
            including case studies, works-in-progress, and conceptual
            explorations.

          <p>
            ISMS 2023 aims to provide a forum for researchers from both academia
            and industry to share their latest research contributions, future
            vision in the field and potential impact across industries of
            information systems and management sciences. Join us, 23-24 December
            2023, to explore discovery, progress, and achievements related to
            various information systems and management sciences. This conference
            is basically focused on advanced automation, computational
            optimization (AI and DL) in all information systems based
            applications as well as include specific plenary sessions, invited
            talks and paper presentations focusing on the applications of IOT in
            the fields of management science, business and Social Media and
            other relevant domains. The ISMS 2023 will provide its attendees an
            uncommon opportunity to expand their network beyond their immediate
            professional environment. It is a unique chance to work with other
            accomplished individuals from diverse areas towards the common goal
            of shaping the future of the communication, computing and society.
